1 bottle of stuff on the wall, 1 bottle of stuff.
Take it down pass it around 0 bottles of stuff on the wall.
0 bottles of stuff on the wall 0 bottles of stuff.

 Simply, I should be able to call your function from the main and give it an integer argument.
 Your function should then count down from the input number until 0, followeing the pattern described above.
