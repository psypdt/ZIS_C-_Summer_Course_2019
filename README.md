# ZIS_C++_Summer_Course_2019
This repo holds all the necessary information for students who are interested in participating in the C++ course that will be taught during the summer.



## Who is this course for?
- This course is for students who have no or very limited programming experience. We do NOT expect that you have any prior knowledge regarding C++ or any other progamming language. This course is constructed for beginners who wish to get a good foundation for programming.




## What to expect from the class dynamic
- Lots of programming. Learning by programming is one of the best way to further your knowledge (and it's loads of fun).  

- Interactive classes. We will work together to find solutions and different ways of approaching a problem.

- Asking questions is by far the best thing to do if something is unclear, so we will always encourage you to ask if you don't understand something.

- We want you to engage with eachother so we will give you small problems to solve with your friends. At the end we will explain one way in which the problem could have been solved (there is mostly more than one way, so don't be discouraged if you don't get it the first time around).




## What to expect from the class content
- We will explore the basic architecture of the computer, how it works and why its important to understand.

- Introduction to how programming can be used to solve real world problems.

- Introduction to procedural programming in C++, and answerign the question "why is C++ useful?".

- Learning the basics of C++, how it works and what does it provide for us.

- How can we use C++ to do something useful, how can we make C++ do math for us, or display information on a screen.


## What can you do in advanced?
- We will be using the https://codeboard.io platform to do our programming, signing up before starting the course would be great, but we will allocate some time to do this before we get started.

- There is no need to study any advanced mathematics, as long as you are confident with simple addition, subtraction multiplication and division you will be fine. Regardless of this, all uses of maths will be explained regardless so that nobody gets confused.



## What do you need during classes?
- If the school supplied you with a laptop then thats all you need.

- If you have an Mac or a machine running Linux or Unix, feel free to use that instead of the school computer.
