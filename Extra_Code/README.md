## Extra section

- Some of you were interested in how we use C++ when creating games. This directory will contain some sample code of a game that I made as a university coursework. 

- Do not expect that you will understand everything, there are a lot of things that we have not covered yet, so don't be dissapointed if you don't understand what's happening.

- This is just to illustrate what game code could look like, obviously this will differe for every game (some may not even use C++), but this just serves as an example.

- You will `NOT` be able to run this code since you would require a lot of dependencies.
